# Pokemon Battle Simulator Game

## Description

This game application was built to allow players to select a fanmade pokemon (also known as fakemon) as their character, set the stats for their character, and go on to defeat as many fusion pokemon as possible to accumulate points.

## Usage

To use this application, the player selects one of the three choices of fakemon to be their character and give it a name. On the next page, the player allocates the given 50 stats to health, attack, speed, and/or defense. Once ready, they can click "Start Battle" to face off against a series of fusion pokemon. Whoever has the higher speed stat will get to attack first.

The player can choose between 4 battle actions: normal attack, strong attack, evade, and defend. Each action has its own pros and cons. Normal attacks are guaranteed to hit the enemy but deliver only 75% of the attack power. Strong attacks could be a hit or miss but deliver 100% of the attack power. As for evasion, the higher the player's speed stat, the more likely they are successful in evading the enemy's attack. If they do succeed in evading, they will take 0 damage while also recover their health points based on their speed. Last but not least, the higher the player's defense stat, the more likely they are able to successfully defending themselves and reflecting back the damage to the opponent. When choosing the defend option, the player will always be able to mitigate at least 5 damage but also take a certain amount of damage too.

Each time a battle action is selected, the opposing fusion pokemon will deliver (most of the time) normal attacks and (sometimes) strong attacks back. Before every strong attack, there will be a warning so the player can calculate their moves and choose accordingly. After every battle win, another fusion pokemon with different stats will appear to challenge the player. The more fusion pokemon they beat until they run out of health points, the higher score they will get. When the game is over, the player will be able to save their score by submitting their nickname to the high score board. Once they have viewed the high scores, they can choose to play again or clear scores.
